## Description

-This is a Note Taker App that can be used to write and save notes. It stores a note that a user put in on the back end and will show that data displayed on the screen to the user.

-I used an Express.js back end nad saved and retrived that note data input by the user from a JSON file. I practiced requiring in different node libraries used in this app such as path and uuid.
