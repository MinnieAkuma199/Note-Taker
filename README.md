## Description

- Users need a place to write down & save notes! I created an app that stores a note that the user put in on the back end and will show that data displayed on the screen to the user.

- I used an Express.js back end nad saved and retrived that note data input by the user from a JSON file. I practiced requiring in different node libraries used in this app such as path and uuid.
